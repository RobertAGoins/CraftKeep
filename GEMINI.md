# CraftyKeep Project Context

## Project Overview
**Current Status:** Initialization / New Project
**Directory:** `CraftyKeep`

This directory is currently the root of a new or empty project. No source code, configuration files, or documentation (other than this file) were found during the initial analysis.

## Directory Structure
- **GEMINI.md**: This file. It serves as a context guide for AI agents (like Gemini) to understand the project structure, conventions, and goals.

## Usage Guide
As the project evolves, this `GEMINI.md` file should be updated to reflect:

1.  **Project Purpose**: What is CraftyKeep? (e.g., A game, a utility, a web app?)
CraftyKeep is a mobile friendly web app designed to help crafters keep track of their work.  It should allow tracking projects,
tracking and searching your stash of unused materials.

2.  **Tech Stack**: Languages, frameworks, and tools used.
3.  **Build & Run Instructions**: How to set up the environment and run the application.
4.  **Conventions**: Coding styles and standard procedures.

## Recommended Next Steps
To initialize the project, consider running commands such as:
- `git init` (to set up version control)
- Framework initialization (e.g., `npx create-react-app .`, `cargo init`, `npm init`, `django-admin startproject ...`)
